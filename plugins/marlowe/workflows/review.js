const GROUNDING = `
GROUNDING DISCIPLINE (non-negotiable):
- Every finding MUST carry at least one concrete file:line anchor you actually read. No anchor → no finding.
- Read the code and trace call sites. Never treat a comment as the source of truth — the code is the only witness that doesn't lie; comments go stale.
- Forbidden phrases: "appears to", "looks like", "seems to", "probably". Either you verified it in the code or it is not a finding.
- This is MACRO-DESIGN critique, not bug-hunting and not lint. Do not report missing error handling, style nits, or correctness bugs. Report SHAPE: why it is structured this way, what would make it cohere.
- Every finding needs a concrete proposed solution — what to move/merge/split/rename and roughly how. "Consider refactoring" is not a solution.
- Be willing to find nothing. An empty findings array is a valid, honest result for a well-shaped target.`

TARGET TO REVIEW (interpret this literally — it may be a path, "the diff"/"the branch", a named subsystem, or a description of some logic):
"""
${target}
"""

Resolve the target into a concrete set of files/directories using the tools available to you:
- For a path/dir: glob it.
- For "the diff" / "the branch" / "uncommitted changes": run the appropriate git command (e.g. git diff --name-only main...HEAD, or git status) to get the file list, then read those files plus enough surrounding context to understand them.
- For a described subsystem or "this logic about X": grep for it and follow the code.

Then build a STRUCTURAL MODEL:
- scope_manifest: the concrete files/dirs you determined are in scope.
- modules: each module/package/significant file with its single-sentence responsibility and what it depends on.
- intended_architecture: the shape the author appears to have intended — layers, boundaries, the flow. If there is no discernible intent, say so plainly (that itself is a signal).
- observations: anything structurally notable to seed deeper lenses.

Read real files. Do not invent paths. Return the structured map.`

FINDING:
${JSON.stringify(finding)}

STRUCTURAL MAP (for context):
${JSON.stringify(map)}

Read the cited code yourself. Then genuinely try to defend the status quo:
- Is this package split / helper / duplication actually a deliberate seam (different layer, different rate of change, different owner, a boundary that will diverge)?
- Would the proposed reshaping introduce coupling, hurt testability, or merge things that only coincidentally look alike?
- Is the "duplicated" logic meaningfully different on close read?
- Are the cited file:line anchors real and do they actually show what the finding claims?

Default to isReal=false if you can construct a reasonable design rationale for the current shape, OR if the anchors don't hold up. Mark isReal=true only when the smell genuinely survives your best defense. If it survives, sharpen the proposed solution.

Return your verdict.`

SURVIVING FINDINGS (after adversarial verification):

Identify gaps:
- Which files/modules in scope_manifest were NOT touched by any surviving finding? Are they genuinely clean, or unexamined?
- Which design questions does the map's intended_architecture raise that no lens asked?
