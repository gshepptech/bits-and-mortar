## Q-001
**Question:** Where should the agent-dispatch logic live?
**Options presented:** operator package | dispatcher package | new package

## A-001 [ARCH_INVARIANT, IMPLICIT_FACT:DEPLOYMENT]
The operator stays generic — only the dispatcher knows about specific agent types. The operator must not import any agent-specific package. [from Q-001]

## Q-002
**Question:** What is the casting lifecycle?
**Options presented:** linear | branching | cyclical

## A-002
When a casting reaches DONE, the orchestrator transitions it from RUNNING to COMPLETED. After F4 ASSAY signs off, COMPLETED becomes ARCHIVED. [from Q-002]

## Q-003
**Question:** What is the surface contract for casting acceptance?
**Options presented:** REST endpoint | MCP tool | CLI

## A-003
The Mill-Accept-Casting tool takes a casting_id (string) and returns {accepted: bool, provenance: {sha256, mtime}}. Errors include INVALID_CASTING_ID and EVIDENCE_MISMATCH. [from Q-003]

## Q-004
**Question:** Should we cache validation responses?
**Options presented:** yes — Redis | yes — in-memory | no

## A-004 [ARCH_INVARIANT]
Validator state stays stateless — every spec validation runs fresh from disk with no caching layer. [from Q-004]

## Q-005
**Question:** What runtime do agents use?
**Options presented:** Python 3.11 | Python 3.12 | Node | Go

## A-005 [IMPLICIT_FACT:RUNTIME]
Python 3.11 [from Q-005]

## Q-006
**Question:** What scale of casting throughput?
**Options presented:** ≤10/hr | 10-100/hr | 100+/hr

## A-006 [IMPLICIT_FACT:SCALE]
≤10/hr [from Q-006]
