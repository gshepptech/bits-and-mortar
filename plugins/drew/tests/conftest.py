"""Pytest fixtures for plugins/drew tests.

Install pytest in the development environment with:

    uvx pytest tests/

(Note: the project is PEP 668-managed; do NOT pip-install pytest globally.
``uvx pytest`` runs in an isolated, ephemeral virtualenv. See Plan 01-01
SUMMARY.md for the canonical invocation.)

This file exposes the following reusable fixtures:

- ``fixtures_dir``: session-scoped path to ``tests/fixtures/``
- ``load_fixture``: function returning the text content of a fixture file
- ``run_validator_subprocess``: function invoking ``validate-spec.py`` via subprocess.
  Takes a (spec_path, transcript_path) pair; the fixture builds a synthesized
  spec on-the-fly so the spec's appendix contains the transcript verbatim and
  every user A-NNN is cited in the body. The static ``spec-minimal.md`` is
  used as a header/title template only — its body is replaced. This was added
  in Plan 01-03 to satisfy the validator's structural checks (APPENDIX_INCOMPLETE,
  UNCITED_ANSWERS, UNSOURCED_BULLET, MISSING_GI_ENTRIES) which were impossible
  to satisfy with one static spec across multiple transcript fixtures.
- ``run_setup_blueprint``: function invoking ``setup-drew.sh`` via subprocess and
  returning the captured ``CompletedProcess`` along with the resolved prompt
  file path (which contains the assembled R0-R4 instructions setup-drew writes
  before the interactive interview begins).
- ``run_typed_validator_subprocess`` (Plan 02-01): function that synthesizes a
  spec body containing the THREE Phase 2 typed tables (invariants /
  state-transitions / contracts) — or omits them entirely when
  ``with_typed_tables=False`` — and invokes validate-spec.py against it. Used
  by Phase 2 RED stubs (test_typed_sections.py) to exercise check_typed_sections
  rules 1/2/3 plus the legacy-v4.2.0 backwards-compat path. The builder shape
  (Option A from 02-01-PLAN.md): ``_build_synthesized_spec`` is extended with a
  ``with_typed_tables`` keyword + auxiliary keyword flags
  (``inject_paraphrase``, ``inject_dangling_citation``,
  ``state_transitions_sentinel``, ``contracts_sentinel``) so a single builder
  serves both Phase 1 and Phase 2 fixtures. Phase 1's
  ``run_validator_subprocess`` fixture continues to use the default
  (``with_typed_tables=False``) and is unchanged in behavior.

    """Build a minimal valid spec body that pairs cleanly with ``transcript_text``.

    The validator (validate-spec.py) enforces several structural checks that
    a static spec-minimal.md cannot satisfy across multiple transcript
    fixtures simultaneously:

      * ``APPENDIX_INCOMPLETE`` — the appendix MUST contain every transcript
        A-NNN (and A-AUTO-NNN) entry verbatim.
      * ``UNCITED_ANSWERS`` — every user A-NNN in the transcript MUST be
        cited somewhere in the spec body. (A-AUTO-NNN is exempt — Plan 03.)
      * ``UNSOURCED_BULLET`` — every bullet/paragraph in
        ``REQUIRED_CITATION_SECTIONS`` MUST carry a citation marker.
      * ``MISSING_GI_ENTRIES`` — when transcript has any ARCH_INVARIANT-tagged
        answer, ``## Global Invariants`` MUST contain at least one
        ``**GI-NNN**`` bullet.

    This builder synthesizes a body that satisfies all four for any given
    transcript. The body deliberately avoids ``### Locked`` subsections and
    ``**GI-NNN**`` bullets-with-quotes so check_locked_fidelity does not
    fire (no verbatim-substring matching needed). When the transcript carries
    any ARCH_INVARIANT-tagged answer, a single ``GI-001`` bullet is added to
    Global Invariants — it does not need a quoted substring because the
    Locked-fidelity check only enforces verbatim quoting on bullets that
    HAVE a quoted substring; absence of a quote is permitted in the relaxed
    fixture-test path. (Plan 03 / INTV-01 — see Plan 01-01 SUMMARY for
    background on why static fixtures don't work here.)

    Phase 2 extension (Plan 02-01):

    When ``with_typed_tables=True`` the builder additionally emits the THREE
    Phase 2 typed tables (invariants / state-transitions / contracts) using
    the column schemas locked in CONTEXT.md. Until Plan 02-03 ships
    ``check_typed_sections``, these tables are inert — the validator does
    not yet inspect them — so emitting them only matters once Plan 02-03
    lands. Plan 02-01 RED stubs verify the validator surface (warnings,
    failure tokens, exit codes) that 02-03 will produce; the typed-table
    spec body shape is the input contract.

    Auxiliary kwargs steer the Phase 2 negative tests:

      * ``inject_paraphrase=True`` — emit a prose paragraph adjacent to the
        invariants table whose tokens overlap a row's content cells at
        Jaccard ≥0.7 (negative test for rule 3).
      * ``inject_dangling_citation=True`` — append a row whose citation cell
        cites ``A-999`` (an A-NNN not in the transcript) — negative test for
        rule 2.
      * ``state_transitions_sentinel=True`` — emit the documented sentinel
        row in ``## State Transitions`` instead of a data row.
      * ``contracts_sentinel=True`` — same shape, in ``## Contracts``.

    When ``with_typed_tables=False`` (default — Phase 1 invocation path),
    the three typed-table headings are OMITTED entirely. The result mirrors
    Phase 1's builder behavior byte-identically so existing Phase 1 tests
    that depend on ``run_validator_subprocess`` are not perturbed by the
    Plan 02-01 extension.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Two new fixtures land here, append-only — none of the Phase 1/2 fixtures
# above are edited:
#
#   1. ``run_versioned_validator_subprocess`` — wraps validate-spec.py with
#      explicit ``spec_format_version`` frontmatter handling. Synthesizes a
#      spec body with the requested frontmatter (or no frontmatter for the
#      implicit-v2.0 path) and forwards Phase 2 builder kwargs via
#      ``**kwargs`` so existing typed-table negative tests can be reused
#      under Phase 3 conditions.
#
#   2. ``run_f05_decompose_with_test_roster`` — STUB ONLY in Plan 03-01.
#      Raises ``pytest.skip(...)`` so the seven Phase 3 RED stubs that
#      consume this fixture are collected but skipped. Plan 03-04 lands the
#      real F0.5 roster-enumeration logic and turns those skips into
#      RED-then-GREEN.

# Regex used to extract a leading `<!-- spec_format_version: vX.Y -->`
# comment from a transcript fixture. The conftest synthesizer uses this
# when the test does NOT pass an explicit `spec_format_version=` kwarg —
# the fixture-comment is the per-fixture default. The version capture is
# anchored to the `vN.N` shape so documentation-prose comments containing
# a placeholder ellipsis (e.g. `<!-- spec_format_version: ... -->` in
# the legacy fixture's narrative) do NOT match — only real version
# literals are extracted.

# Regexes to strip [IMPLICIT_FACT:*] tags from synthesized transcripts when
# `with_implicit_fact_tags=False`. Three patterns to handle the three positional
# cases of an IMPLICIT_FACT:CATEGORY token inside an A-NNN tag bracket:
#   1. Leading/middle position with trailing comma:
#        `[IMPLICIT_FACT:DEPLOYMENT, LOCKED]`     -> `[LOCKED]`
#        `[LOCKED, IMPLICIT_FACT:RUNTIME, OTHER]` -> `[LOCKED, OTHER]`
#   2. Trailing position with preceding comma:
#        `[ARCH_INVARIANT, IMPLICIT_FACT:DEPLOYMENT]` -> `[ARCH_INVARIANT]`
#   3. Sole tag (no comma siblings) — entire bracket pair removed (with the
#      space before it) so the header doesn't keep an empty `[]`:
#        `## A-002 [IMPLICIT_FACT:DEPLOYMENT]` -> `## A-002`
# Plan 03-01's original single-pattern shape (`\[IMPLICIT_FACT:CAT\]`) only
# handled case 3 and missed combined-tag fixtures (e.g. v21_missing_implicit
# transcript fixture which uses `[ARCH_INVARIANT, IMPLICIT_FACT:DEPLOYMENT]`).

    tmp_path: Path,
) -> Callable[..., subprocess.CompletedProcess]:
    """Plan 03-01 fixture for Phase 3 (TYPE-02) versioned-spec-format tests.

    Builds a synthesized spec body via ``_build_synthesized_spec`` (Phase
    1/2 builder) and prepends a ``spec_format_version: {value}`` frontmatter
    block when ``spec_format_version`` is non-None. When ``spec_format_version``
    is None (the implicit-v2.0 path), the synthesized body is written
    verbatim — Phase 3's frontmatter parser (Plan 03-02) defaults missing
    frontmatter to v2.0.

    Note: ``_build_synthesized_spec`` already emits its OWN
    ``spec_format_version: v2.0`` frontmatter block. To avoid double-
    frontmatter (which would yield malformed YAML), this fixture rewrites
    the existing frontmatter line via a regex substitution rather than
    prepending a second YAML block.

    Usage:
        # v2.1 happy path:
        result = run_versioned_validator_subprocess(
            "transcript_versioned_modern",
            spec_format_version="v2.1",
        )
        assert result.returncode == 0

        # Unknown version (Phase 3 hard-fail):
        result = run_versioned_validator_subprocess(
            "transcript_versioned_unknown",
            spec_format_version="v9.0",
        )
        assert result.returncode != 0

        # No frontmatter (implicit v2.0):
        result = run_versioned_validator_subprocess(
            "transcript_versioned_legacy",
            spec_format_version=None,  # also: omit, default is None
        )
        assert result.returncode == 0

    Behaviour details:
      - ``transcript_name`` may be a bare stem or include the ``.md`` suffix.
      - When ``spec_format_version`` is None and the transcript has a
        ``<!-- spec_format_version: vX.Y -->`` comment at top, the comment
        value is extracted and used as the version. (The leading comment
        line is stripped from the transcript body before synthesis so the
        comment never appears in the synthesized appendix.)
      - When ``spec_format_version`` is None AND no comment is present
        (legacy fixture path), the synthesized spec is written WITHOUT any
        spec_format_version frontmatter line — the validator's frontmatter
        parser must default this to v2.0. The fixture explicitly removes
        the ``_build_synthesized_spec`` builder's default v2.0 frontmatter
        line so the implicit-default code path is exercised end-to-end.
      - ``with_typed_tables`` and other ``**kwargs`` forward to the Phase 1/2
        builder unchanged. Typical Phase 3 negative tests pair
        ``spec_format_version="v2.1"`` with ``with_typed_tables=False`` to
        exercise Plan 03-03's warn→fail upgrade.
      - ``with_implicit_fact_tags=False`` strips ``[IMPLICIT_FACT:*]`` tags
        from the synthesized transcript before validate-spec.py reads it,
        mirroring the Phase 2 ``inject_paraphrase``-style negative-test
        kwarg pattern. Used by ``test_v21_missing_implicit_hard_fails``.

    Plan 03-04 ownership: this fixture stays unchanged across Plans 03-02 /
    03-03 / 03-04. Only the validator's behaviour (validate-spec.py) shifts.

    """Plan 03-04 harness for F0.5 V2 step 2b's stream-skip enumeration.

    Mirrors the prose at ``plugins/mason/commands/start.md`` F0.5 V2 steps
    2a / 2b / 2c and the F0.9 sub-check 7k re-derivation block. Returns a
    parsed manifest dict with the same shape that a real Mill F0.5 run
    would produce, plus an ``f09_diagnostics`` joined-string field for the
    five Plan 03-04 RED-to-GREEN tests.

    RESEARCH.md Pitfall 7 calls out the drift risk between this harness's
    Python logic and start.md's prose. Drift detection lives in:
      (a) ``test_f05_step_2b_and_f09_7k_reference_same_roster`` — asserts
          both prose blocks list the same agent-path set OR sub-check 7k
          uses the explicit "same hardcoded list as F0.5 step 2b"
          by-reference phrase;
      (b) reviewer grep for ``STREAM_SKIP_INCOMPLETE`` /
          ``STREAM_SKIP_UNEXPECTED`` / ``STREAM_SKIP_MALFORMED`` in both
          ``conftest.py`` and ``start.md`` — drift surfaces as
          mismatched grep counts.

    Args:
        spec_format_version: literal string (``"v2.0"`` / ``"v2.1"`` /
            ``None``). ``None`` is the implicit-v2.0 path (matches
            start.md F0.5 step 2a's "absent → default to v2.0" rule).
        extra_agent_paths: optional list of synthetic agent fixture paths
            to inject into the roster IN ADDITION to the default Phase 3
            ship-state roster. Plan 03-01's
            ``tests/fixtures/agents/agent_phase3_test_stream.md`` is the
            canonical injection (declares ``min_spec_format_version: v2.1``
            so a v2.0 spec produces a deterministic skip record).
        omit_required_record: if True, force ``stream_skips`` to ``[]``
            even when a record SHOULD have been emitted. Used by
            ``test_f09_subcheck_7k_catches_missing`` to drive the F0.9
            sub-check 7k STREAM_SKIP_INCOMPLETE error path.
        inject_unexpected_record: if True, append a record for an
            already-rostered agent whose min ≤ spec version (false
            positive). Used by ``test_f09_subcheck_7k_catches_unexpected``
            to drive the STREAM_SKIP_UNEXPECTED error path.
        inject_malformed_record: if True, append a record missing
            required keys to drive the STREAM_SKIP_MALFORMED error path.

    Returns:
        dict with keys:
          - ``spec_format_version`` (str | None) — input literal verbatim
          - ``spec_format_version_tuple`` (tuple[int,int]) — parsed tuple
          - ``stream_skips`` (list[dict]) — F0.5 V2 step 2b emission
          - ``stdout_summary`` (str) — F0.5 V2 step 2c summary line
          - ``f09_diagnostics`` (str) — newline-joined sub-check 7k tokens
            (joined string preserves ``in`` substring lookups in the
            Plan 03-01 stubs without requiring assertion edits)

    Plan 03-04 ownership: harness body lands here; Plan 03-01's pytest.skip
    stub is removed. Future phases (6/7/8) update ``_DEFAULT_F05_ROSTER``
    above to add their agent paths in lock-step with start.md F0.5 V2
    step 2b's hardcoded list.
