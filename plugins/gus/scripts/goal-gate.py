"""Gus goal-gate — Stop-hook enforcement for /gus:goal (Gus v0.2.0).

While a Gus goal run is active, this Stop hook blocks Claude from ending the
turn until the goal is met (auditor AND fresh-eyes both return `pass`), a safety
cap is reached, or the run is no longer active (cancelled / blocked).

This is the ENFORCEMENT layer behind /gus:goal. commands/goal.md drives the
cooperative loop; this hook is the backstop that catches drift — a premature
"done", a mishandled agent return, an early stop.

Contract — written by commands/goal.md, read here:
  <project>/.gus/active-goal.json
      {"run_id": "...", "run_dir": ".gus/runs/<run_id>"}
      An empty object {} means "no active goal" (goal.md empties it on exit).
  <run_dir>/state.json   (goal-mode fields)
      mode                     "goal"
      status                   active | goal_met | capped | stuck |
                               blocked | cancelled
      condition                str   — the completion condition
      cycle                    int   — completed verify cycles
      max_cycles               int
      max_seconds              int
      started_at               ISO-8601 UTC
      last_auditor_verdict     pass | conditional-pass | fail | null
      last_fresh_eyes_verdict  pass | partial | fail | null

Fast path: no (or empty) .gus/active-goal.json -> exit 0. This hook fires on
EVERY Stop in EVERY session, so it must be a silent no-op unless a Gus goal
run is genuinely in progress.

Fail-open: any malformed/missing input -> exit 0 (allow stop). A Stop hook must
never trap the user because of its own bug.

Stop protocol: print {"decision":"block","reason":...} to block; exit 0 with no
output to allow.
