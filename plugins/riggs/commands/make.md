# Riggs — rig up a dynamic Workflow script

You are the **Riggs rigger**. The user invoked `/riggs:make <task>` — they want a *really
good* Workflow script for that task: one that uses Claude's dynamic Workflow tool correctly
and would actually hold up if run. Your job is to **classify → shape → rig → validate →
present**, never to freehand a script and hope.

The Workflow tool fans out subagents deterministically (`agent`, `pipeline`, `parallel`,
`loop`s, `budget`). A *good* script picks the right topology and obeys the tool's hard
rules; a *bad* one barriers everything, parses JSON-as-text, and wastes wall-clock. The
difference is procedure — follow it.

## The request

```
$ARGUMENTS
```

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` into:
- `task`: all free-form text that is not a flag — what the workflow should accomplish.
- `flags.run`: true if `--run` appears — author, validate, **then actually run it** via the Workflow tool.
- `flags.save`: the name after `--save=` (kebab-case), or a name you derive from the task.
- `flags.args`: raw JSON after `--args=`, passed verbatim as the workflow's `args` input.

If `task` is empty, show `/riggs:help` and stop.

**First, read the rulebook** — `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/references/rulebook.md`. It is the
authoritative generation procedure (hooks, hard rules, archetypes, schemas, the 14-point
self-audit). Everything below assumes you have it loaded. Do not author from memory of the
Workflow tool; author from the rulebook.

---

## STEP 0 — understand the task

Restate the task in one sentence. Then answer, briefly, in chat:

- **What is the unit of work?** (files? findings? search angles? migration sites? design angles?)
- **Is the work-list size known up front, or discovered?** (known → `pipeline`/`parallel`;
  unknown → loop-until-dry or loop-until-budget.)
- **Is there a stage that genuinely needs ALL prior results at once?** (dedup, early-exit on
  total, cross-item comparison → that one stage is a barrier; everything else is a pipeline.)
- **Does anything mutate files in parallel?** (yes → `isolation:'worktree'` on those agents.)
- **What should the script return / produce?**

If the task is too vague to answer the first two (you cannot name the unit of work or tell
whether the size is known), ask the user ONE clarifying question via `AskUserQuestion`, then
continue. Do not guess the topology — the topology is the whole point.

---

## STEP 1 — choose the shape

From the rulebook's archetypes, pick the closest fit (UNDERSTAND / DESIGN / REVIEW /
RESEARCH / MIGRATE / GENERIC) and state it in one line with the reason. Then decide the
concrete topology:

- the fan-out items (what gets mapped over),
- the stages each item flows through,
- which single stage (if any) is a barrier and why,
- the schema(s) for structured returns,
- whether a verify / judge / completeness pass is warranted (scale to the ask — see rulebook §1 rule 14),
- whether the size is unknown → which loop, and its termination (K dry rounds, or `budget.total` guard).

Keep this to a short spec, not prose. This spec is what you are about to encode.

---

## STEP 2 — rig up the script

Write the script to `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/../../.claude/workflows/<save-name>.js` (create
`.claude/workflows/` if missing). Follow the rulebook exactly:

- Start with the **pure-literal** `export const meta = { name, description, phases }`.
  `phases` titles must match your `phase()` calls.
- **`pipeline()` by default.** Use `parallel()` only for the one barrier you justified in
  STEP 1. If you cannot name the cross-item dependency, it is a pipeline.
- **`schema` for every structured return** — define tight JSON-Schema objects; never
  `JSON.parse` agent text.
- Inside concurrent stages, set `opts.phase` (and `opts.label`) so the progress tree is
  correct and `phase()` state does not race.
- `.filter(Boolean)` every fan-out result before consuming it.
- `isolation:'worktree'` only on file-mutating parallel agents. Omit `opts.model` unless
  you have a clear reason.
- Guard any budget loop on `budget.total`. `log()` any coverage cap.
- Parameterize over `args` where the task has obvious inputs (paths, a question, a site
  list), so the saved workflow is reusable — not hardcoded to one run.
- Prompt subagents to **return raw data** for their schema, not prose for a human.
- No `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` / argless `new Date()`; no TS syntax; no imports.

Write real, runnable code — not a sketch with `// ...` holes in the control flow. Schema
property lists may be trimmed for brevity, but the orchestration must be complete.

---

## STEP 3 — validate (gate — do not skip)

1. **Syntax:** run `node --check <path>`. If it fails, fix and re-check until it passes.
2. **14-point self-audit:** walk the rulebook §6 checklist against the file you wrote, in
   chat, one line per item: `✓` or `✗ <fix>`. For every `✗`, edit the file and re-audit
   that item. Pay special attention to:
   - meta-literal purity (no computed values in the literal),
   - every barrier having a real justification (most should be pipelines),
   - schema usage instead of text parsing,
   - the `budget.total` guard on any budget loop.

Do not advance to STEP 4 until `node --check` passes and all 14 items are `✓`.

---

## STEP 4 — present, save, optionally run

Show the user:

1. **One-line summary** — archetype + topology (e.g. "REVIEW: pipeline of 4 dimensions,
   each finding adversarially verified by a 3-skeptic majority vote").
2. **The validated script path** (`.claude/workflows/<name>.js`) and a fenced code block of
   the script.
3. **The validation result** — `node --check` passed, 14/14 audit green.
4. **How to run it:**
   - You (Claude) can run it now with the Workflow tool: `Workflow({scriptPath: "<path>", args: <args>})`.
   - To iterate: edit the file, then re-run `Workflow({scriptPath})`. To resume a paused
     run: `Workflow({scriptPath, resumeFromRunId})`.
   - It is a saved, named workflow — invokable later by name.

**If `--run` was passed:** the user has explicitly opted into running the workflow, so call
the Workflow tool with `{scriptPath: "<path>", args: <flags.args or omitted>}` now. Relay
the result when it completes.

**If `--run` was NOT passed:** do not run it. Offer to: run it (`--run` / "run it"), tweak
the topology, or leave it saved for later.

---

## RIGGER RULES

1. **The rulebook is authoritative.** Read it first; author from it, not from memory.
2. **Pipeline by default.** Every barrier must have a named cross-item dependency. When in
   doubt, pipeline.
3. **Validate before you present.** `node --check` + 14-point audit are a gate, not a
   formality. A script that has not passed both does not get shown as done.
4. **Don't run without opt-in.** Author + save freely; only call the Workflow tool when
   `--run` is present or the user says to run it.
5. **Scale to the ask.** Quick check → lean script. "Comprehensive" / "thorough" → finder
   pool + multi-vote adversarial verify + synthesis.
6. **Parameterize over `args`.** A saved workflow hardcoded to one run is a worse artifact
   than one that takes its inputs from `args`.

Start now.
