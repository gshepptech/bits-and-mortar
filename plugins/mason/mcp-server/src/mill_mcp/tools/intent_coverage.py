"""Phase 8 / INTENT-01 — Mill-Intent-Coverage MCP tool.

Thin subprocess wrapper around plugins/mill/scripts/validate-intent-coverage.py.
Returns structured result with action='proceed_to_validate' on pass,
action='redecompose' on any DROPPED verdict, action='rerun_intent_carrier'
when intent-coverage.json is missing.

F0.7 gate semantics:
  - PASS (zero DROPPED): stamps .f07-intent-clean marker; orchestrator
    transitions to F0.9 VALIDATE.
  - FAIL (any DROPPED): returns redecompose action + dropped_answers list
    + redecompose_hints; orchestrator routes lead BACK to F0.5 DECOMPOSE
    with the missing A-NNN list as guidance. NEVER amends casting prompts
    in place (REQUIREMENTS.md Out of Scope).

Locked decisions (per 08-RESEARCH.md Open Questions 2 + 3):
  - On pass: stamp .f07-intent-clean marker file in run dir.
  - On fail: structured payload with action / dropped_answers /
    redecompose_hints / hint / validator_stdout / validator_exit.
