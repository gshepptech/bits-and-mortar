"""Mill handoff audit log.

Every handoff event in a Mill run must be recorded through
`Mill-Handoff`. This creates an inspectable trail showing which
artifacts were produced from which sources, with integrity hashes,
and whether the lead re-read the source before the handoff happened.

Handoff events:
  - spec_to_casting:     spec.md → castings/manifest.json + casting-N-prompt.md
  - casting_to_teammate: casting-N-prompt.md → Agent spawn
  - teammate_to_accepted: teammate completion report → lead acceptance
  - inspect_to_grind:    defects → grind tasks
  - grind_to_inspect:    grind fixes → re-verification
  - assay_to_done:       ASSAY verdicts → F6 DONE
  - spec_to_decompose:   (re-read) lead re-reads spec before decomposing
  - any other transition the lead wants audited

The log is JSONL at `mill-archive/{run}/handoffs.jsonl` (machine
readable) and mirrored to `handoffs.md` (human readable).
