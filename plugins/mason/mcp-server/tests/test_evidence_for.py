"""Phase 5 / EVID-02 RED scaffolding.

Mirrors plugins/mill/mcp-server/tests/test_evidence.py shape (Phase 4 /
EVID-01) verbatim. All stubs SKIP or fail until Plans 05-02 (parser) and
05-03 (coverage diff + mill_accept_casting integration) land bodies.

Plan 05-04 lands teammate.md Step 11 + start.md F0.5 informational note;
no test surface for those (they are doc edits — verified via grep).

Stub allocation:

Plan 05-02 territory (parser + token allowlist) — 4 stubs that fail
meaningfully via assert against the expected post-05-02 behavior:
  - test_known_header_directives_includes_for
  - test_evidence_for_clean_parsed_to_list
  - test_evidence_for_malformed_raises_token
  - test_failure_tokens_includes_unbound_and_malformed

Plan 05-03 territory (coverage diff + mill_accept_casting integration +
provenance schema extension) — 5 stubs that pytest.skip until Plan 05-03
wires the gate; flip to live assertions when 05-03 lands:
  - test_provenance_record_has_evidence_for_field
  - test_unbound_requirements_rejects_with_named_ids
  - test_many_to_many_overlap_accepts
  - test_omit_evidence_for_header_rejects
  - test_v20_legacy_bypasses_evidence_for_check

Pitfall 5 guard — 1 stub that asserts inline-`#` capture behavior:
  - test_evidence_for_with_inline_comment_captures_all_ids

RED-or-SKIP discipline mirrors Phase 4 Plan 04-01:

- Module-top ``importorskip("mill_mcp.tools.evidence")`` allows the module
  to SKIP cleanly even if the production module breaks temporarily during
  Plan 05-02's parser edit.
- Plan 05-02 territory stubs raise AssertionError live (the parser /
  allowlist edits are local; tests fire as-soon-as Plan 05-02 ships).
- Plan 05-03 territory stubs use ``pytest.skip("Plan 05-03 territory")``
  because the integration path (verify_evidence + mill_accept_casting +
  manifest synthesis) is multi-step and lands as one wave.
